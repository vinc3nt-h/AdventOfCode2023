## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place throughout the month of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants solve it using their programming skills. It's a great way to improve problem-solving abilities and explore various programming languages.

The repository is organized by days, with each day corresponding to a specific Advent of Code challenge. Inside each day's folder, you will find the solutions in one or more programming languages. The code is provided as-is and may not be the most elegant or optimized solution, as the primary focus is on the learning experience.
